Security Design:
CIA Triad: 
A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when seting up systems and security policies. 
These are three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. 

Security controls 
Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. These are used alongside security frameworks. 

Security Framework: 
Guidelines to build plans to mitigate threats and risks to data and privacy. A framework has the following four components:
* Identifying and documenting security goals
* Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
* Implementing strong security processes
* Monitoring and communicating results 

CIA stands for 
==================
* Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific assets. For example, to ensure that confidential data remains safe, strict access controls must be in place.

* Integrity: Data is correct, reliable and authentic. As a security professional, you can use methods like Encryption to maintain Data integrity.

* Availability: Data is available to those who are authorized to access it. 

* Asset: Item perceived to have value to an organization. For example, an asset that stores sensitive information will have more value to the organization than an asset like a website that displays publicly available information. 

Cybersecurity Framework (CFS):
===============================
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risks. 
This framework is used to manage short and long-term risks. 

Ethics in Cybersecurity:
===========================
Confidentiality: As a security professional, you may encounter PII. As a professional, your job is to keep this information confidential. For example, you may encountre a situation where you have to give access outside 

Privacy: Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized access. For exmaple, if your manager asks you to send a personal phone number of an emploee outside of working hours, then, although tricky, it is best to adhere to documented policies. 

Laws: rules recognized by communities and enforced by governing entities. 

Security ethics: Guidlelines to make approporate decisions as a security professional. 

Terms and definitions from Course 1, Module 3
Asset: An item perceived as having value to an organization 

Availability: The idea that data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it

Compliance: The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations

Confidentiality: The idea that only authorized users can access specific assets or data

Confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA) triad: A model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies

Hacktivist: A person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): A U.S. federal law established to protect patients' health information

Integrity: The idea that the data is correct, authentic, and reliable

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework (CSF): A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

Privacy protection: The act of safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use

Protected health information (PHI): Information that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual

Security architecture: A type of security design composed of multiple components, such as tools and processes, that are used to protect an organization from risks and external threats

Security controls: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

Security ethics: Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional

Security frameworks: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy

Security governance: Practices that help support, define, and direct security efforts of an organization

Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII): A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines
