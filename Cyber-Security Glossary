Key cybersecurity terms and concepts: 
There are many terms and concepts that are important for security professionals to know. Being familiar with them can help you better identify the threats that can harm organizations and people alike. A security analyst or cybersecurity analyst focuses on monitoring networks for breaches. They also help develop strategies to secure an organization and research information technology (IT) security trends to remain alert and informed about potential threats. Additionally, an analyst works to prevent incidents. In order for analysts to effectively do these types of tasks, they need to develop knowledge of the following key concepts. 

* Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

* Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

* Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

* Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

* A threat actor, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

* An internal threat can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.

* Network security is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.

* Cloud security is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

* Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:

  Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)

  Reviewing web traffic 

  Alerting suspicious activity

* Malware: A software program that is intended to attack devices or network
* Virus: A Malware that modifies other computer programs by installing its own code to damage and/ or destroy data. 
* Worm: Malware that self-replicates, spreading across network and infecting computers. 
* Ransomware: A malicious attack during which threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore it.
* Spyware: A malicious software installed on a user's computer without their permission, used to spy or steal data.
* Phishing: Use of digital communication to trick people into revealing sensitive data or installing malicious software. 
* Spear Phishing: A malicious email attach on a specific user or a group of users that appears from a trusted source. 
* Whaling: A form of spear phishing in which threat actors target executives to get access to sensitive data. 
* Business Email Compromise (BEC): An attack in which a threat actor impersonates a known source to obtain financial advantage. 
* Vishing: Exploitation of electronic voice communication or impersonate a person to obtain sensitive information.
* Social Engineering: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain unauthorized access to sensitive, private, and/or valuable data
* Social Media Phishing: An attack in which a threat actor collects detailed information about their target on social media sites before initiating an attack.
* Watering hole attack: An attack in which a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users
* Physical social engineering: An attack in which a threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.
* USB baiting: An attack in which a threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and unknowingly infect a network.

Understanding the eight domains of security professionals:
1. Security and Risk Management: Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and law. For example, security analyst may need to update policies on private health information. Ex. Social Engineering attacks.

2. Asset Security: Focusses on security of physical and digital assets. It also pertains to storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. For example, as a security analyst you may be required to physically destroy storage. Ex. Physical attack.

3. Security Architecture and Engineering: Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place. For example, you may be tasked to set up a company's firewall.

4. Communication and Network Security: Focusses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. For example, as a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behaviour within your organization. In case users are exposed to unsecured hotspots, they may be vulnerable to attacks. As a security analyst, you may be tasked to setup a network policy to prevent and mitigate exposure. Ex. Password attack. Adverse AI attacks 

5. Identity and Access Management: Focusses on keeping data secure by ensuring users follow established practices to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, logical assets such as networks and applications. Validating user access and documenting the access role is important. For example, you may be tasked to validate employee's key card access to an office building.  Ex. Adverse AI attacks

6. Security Assessment and Testing: Focusses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, conducting security audits to monitor risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. 

7. Security Operations: Focusses on conducting investigations and implementing preventive measures. 

8. Software Development Security: using secure coding practices to create secure applications and services. Security analyst may work with Software Development teams to ensure security practices are incorporates in software development.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF ATTACKS:
---------------------------
* Password attack: A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. 
  Some forms of password attacks are:  
    Brute force 
    Rainbow table

  Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

* Social engineering attack: Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are: 
    Phishing
    Smishing
    Vishing
    Spear phishing
    Whaling
    Social media phishing
    Business Email Compromise (BEC)
    Watering hole attack
    USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting
    Physical social engineering 

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

* Physical attack: A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:
    Malicious USB cable
    Malicious flash drive
    Card cloning and skimming
  Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain. 

* Adversarial artificial intelligence
  Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates 
  artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

* Supply-chain attack: A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

* Cryptographic attack: A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 
    Birthday
    Collision
    Downgrade

  Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

* TYPES OF THREAT ACTORS:

* Advanced persistent threats: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include: Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources

Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

* Insider threats: Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

  Sabotage
  Corruption
  Espionage
Unauthorized data access or leaks 

* Hacktivists: Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

    Demonstrations
    Propaganda
    Social change campaigns
    Fame

** TYPES OF HACKERS:**

A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. 
There are three main categories of hackers:
* Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.
* Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
* Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

Note: There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

To learn and enhance their hacking skills
To seek revenge
To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered unethical or ethical hackers. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.

There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.
