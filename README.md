This repository is a collection of few of my work samples. It contains the following samples:
* **Quick Reference Guide on Generating Prompts Effectively**: This is a Quick Reference Guide on generating effective prompts, designed to help users craft precise and impactful AI inputs. Using a free Canva template, I have customized the layout to present key concepts in a clear, structured, and visually engaging format.
